Tokenize - Reward yourself for building habits

This is my first try of developing android apps in kotlin.
It its current state it is merely a proof of concept, not a usable app!
The idea of the app is to reward yourself for building habits.

For example, you might want to establish the habit of doing sports regularly. Why not reward yourself with a fancy new gadget (e.g. a new smartwatch) for reaching that goal?
With tokenize you can define a reward that has a certain price attached to it (e. g. a smartwatch) and choose one or more activities that you need to do in order to reward yourself with it.
You pay yourself a certain amount (e.g. 5 $)  each time you do the activity, which gets you closer to your reward..
In behavioral psychology, this "bribing system" is called token economy, hence the name of the app.
